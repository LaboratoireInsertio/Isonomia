# Isonomia

Isonomia, is an intervention that seeks to change the relationship between the passersby and the public space through the implementation of a participatory public infrastructure offering a form of control over the appearance of the given space. This repository holds the processing code and libraries necessary to control the infrastructure developed for the project.

**BEWARE:** The current version uses a processing XBee library that only works in Processing 2.0.3. Moreover, Processing 2.0.3 does not run on Mac OS X El Capitan, so you will need a computer running on Mac OS X Yosemite or older (or Windows?).

For more detailed information on how to set up the project refer to the [Isonomia::Set_up_tutorial](http://insertio.com/teamfeed/isonomia_set_up_tutorial/) on the Insertioâ€™s Team Feed.
